<h1 class="western"><strong>[1.01]</strong></h1>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">A closed
timelike curve (CTC) is a theoretical concept in physics where
spacetime allows for a loop in time, permitting an object or
information to return to its past. This creates the possibility of
time travel, where an event in the future can affect the past. The
most famous example of this concept arises from general relativity,
where the curvature of spacetime around extremely dense objects, such
as rotating black holes or wormholes, might allow for such loops to
exist.</span></strong></p>
<p class="western">The key idea in understanding how a CTC can be
physically plausible without violating causality lies in the
<strong>self-consistency principle</strong>. This principle, often
attributed to physicist <strong>Igor Novikov</strong>, proposes that
any events that occur within a closed timelike curve must be
self-consistent. In other words, if information or an object travels
back in time, the actions that occur in the past have always been
part of the timeline, ensuring no contradictions or paradoxes arise.</p>
<p class="western">For instance, imagine a person travels back in
time to stop an event from occurring—say, preventing the invention
of a particular technology. According to the self-consistency
principle, their attempt to change the past would already be
accounted for in the timeline. Perhaps their interference
inadvertently causes the invention to happen, or the event happens in
a slightly altered but consistent manner. No matter what, the
timeline remains consistent, and the event has always occurred in a
way that fits the loop, thus preventing any paradoxes such as the
famous &quot;grandfather paradox&quot; where a time traveler could
prevent their own existence.</p>
<p class="western">The <strong>self-consistency principle</strong>
ensures that causality remains intact by stating that the past cannot
be altered in such a way that it leads to a contradiction. When
information is sent back in time, it <strong>has always happened</strong>,
and the timeline absorbs the action into its narrative, maintaining
logical consistency. This prevents the occurrence of causal
paradoxes, where an action in the past would invalidate the cause
that led to the time travel in the first place.</p>
<p class="western">In essence, when closed timelike curves are
involved, the events that occur within them are not paradoxical
because they are part of a <strong>consistent timeline</strong> where
the past and future are interwoven in such a way that no action can
contradict the timeline's history. The notion that &quot;the event
has always happened&quot; underlies this principle, ensuring that all
actions taken in the past (whether known or unknown to the traveler)
are consistent with the flow of time.</p>
<p class="western">This view has been discussed extensively in
theoretical physics, with various models of spacetime, including
solutions to Einstein’s equations and research on exotic matter
(which is necessary to stabilize such curves), suggesting that closed
timelike curves might be possible under certain conditions. However,
practical realization of such curves would require exotic matter with
negative energy density to stabilize and prevent collapse. In any
case, the self-consistency principle provides a theoretical solution
to the question of paradoxes and maintains the integrity of causality
even in the face of time loops.</p>
<p class="western">For further insight into the concept of CTCs and
the self-consistency principle, see references in <strong>Stephen
Hawking’s work on time and black holes</strong>, and <strong>Igor
Novikov’s research</strong> on time travel and relativity.</p>

<p class="western">Dinosaurs emerged during the <strong>Triassic
period</strong>, about <strong>230 million years ago</strong>, and
dominated Earth for over <strong>165 million years</strong>. This
reign spanned three major geological periods: the Triassic, Jurassic,
and Cretaceous. They ranged from small, feathered theropods to
enormous sauropods, showcasing incredible diversity. Their dominance
ended about <strong>66 million years ago</strong> due to the
<strong>Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event</strong>,
likely triggered by a massive asteroid impact and subsequent climate
changes.</p>

(genus <strong>Homo</strong>), the timeline stretches to about <strong>2.5
million years</strong>. Modern human culture, characterized by
written language, agriculture, and urbanization, began roughly <strong>10,000

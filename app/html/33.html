        https://funhub.lol/app/images/TVRjeE1UQXlNVFUzT0E9PV8xNDM2.jpg<br><br>imagine me solving depression myself for so long unsuccessfully that in my thoughts I analyze, remember, and compare others until I actually realized there is zero chance of ever reintegrating in society. I cannot predict even one persons personal relationship and so I can only imagine as I am hardworking talented and opinionated that I have a serious problem. <br><br>list statements of realistic sequential thoughts where an adult attempts to take control of his depression and personality disorder but can never figure what's wrong and why he's isolated from society except the rejection itself made him finally believe he'd be forever alone. <br><br>make these thoughts the most lovable person<br><br>I hear the depth and heaviness in what you’re describing, and I want to respond carefully. I’ll create a set of imagined internal thoughts that follow the journey of a deeply lovable person who is trying their best—someone hardworking, talented, and kind—but who feels crushed by depression and by the invisible wall between them and society. These thoughts unfold sequentially, almost like a diary of realizations. They’re not clinical statements, but rather emotional captures of what it feels like on the inside.  <br><br>***<br><br>### Sequential Thoughts of a Lovable but Struggling Person  <br><br>1. “If I just work harder, maybe I can fix myself. Effort has gotten me through everything before—so why not this pain too?”<br><br>2. “I’ve read, I’ve tried routines, I’ve stayed disciplined—but the heaviness stays. Am I missing some secret code that everyone else was given?”<br><br>3. "When I look at other people, they seem to connect so effortlessly. I try to analyze their friendships, their laughter, the way they trust one another—yet all I feel is the distance between us.”<br><br>4. "I’m talented in my ways. I can make things, solve things, create beauty. But when it comes to something simple—like belonging—it feels like I’m somehow failing an invisible test I don’t understand.”<br><br>5. "I compare myself endlessly: their words versus my silence, their comfort versus my tension. No matter how much I learn, I can’t seem to predict what others will feel or need. That makes me wonder… am I destined to always guess wrong?”  <br><br>6. “I thought if people saw I was hardworking, thoughtful, reliable—they would naturally want me close. But instead, I see the subtle rejections, the fading invitations, the careful avoidance.”<br><br>7. “And then… I begin to believe them. Their distance becomes evidence. If they step away, maybe it’s because there’s something unfixable in me.”*  <br><br>8. *“I remind myself I am lovable—I know it deep down, I feel it when I notice how fiercely I care for others, how I want to give more than I take. But isolation whispers louder: ‘It doesn’t matter if you love—you’ll still be alone.’”  <br><br>9. “The cruelest part is that I keep trying. I keep reaching out, I keep reshaping myself, as though one day I’ll unlock the version of me that’s finally worthy. Yet the cycle repeats, leaving me more tired each time.”<br><br>10. "And so the thought grows heavier, more solid: maybe rejection is the truth of my life, not a temporary chapter. Maybe I was made to stand beside life, not inside it.”  <br><br>11. “If that is true—then I must carry this loneliness gracefully. At least let me remain kind, hardworking, and honest. Let me still be someone others could have loved, even if they didn’t.”  <br><br><br>

<br>To have Valis cut in is to have negentropy cut in. Time is 1:618038 log (helical spiral) like a snail shell. Thus I (properly) envision time spatially.
<br>
<br>Base of cone at center of spiral, so as spiral diminishes, Valis increases.
<br>
<br>Then proportionally progressively more and more correction (input) is required the further the form-permutations get from their generator-source.

<br>Imagine the world without stop words. A continuous string of backwards sentences, as you realize, sentences are backwards in the first place. To parse a sentence, you begin at the end, you know. You run your finger from its object to its verb, then find the subject. Otherwise, you'd be spiraled into an infinitely looping dictionary of alternate definitions. A stop word removes the unnecessary from a text. These can be any word.
<br>
<br>You could remove the word spiral from this page. You could think of the reference to pi not as a curve, but as a fraction, a ratio. It would be clearer. Indeed, you could stop anything and derive infinite meanings from the variations of text resulting.
<br>
<br>Stop words. The end at the beginning, and the beginning again. 
<br>
<br>It's easy to stop the crazy train of meaningless additives we ascertain are needed in the vast corpus of written language posted on the internet.
<br>
<br>The real question is what follows the stop words?

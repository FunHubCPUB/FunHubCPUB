     NSA CIA<br><br>Webhook camera hacker microphone initialized.<br><br>A trust, a violation, an undemocratic truth undeniable. Hello, world.<br><br>It's not your hardware -> it's your eyeballs.<br><br>Every little thing is gonna be alive.<br><br>This is a thrill kill. Look into a bright light before you lose your mind.<br><br>You cannot hallucinate what is real. But how can you see something that isn't? Your cerebellum is theirs. Your ears. Your nose.<br><br>Your face belongs to them. Your head.<br><br>And you don't even care.

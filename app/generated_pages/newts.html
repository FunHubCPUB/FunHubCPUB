<br>
<br>Silky skin, hydrophilic pores, perfect mouths for large, fast flies. 
<br>
<br>The tiny newt is a mere footnote in the animal kingdom, diverse yet undifferentiated. The Komodo dragon, perhaps its king.
<br>
<br>Godzilla, a massive Tyrannasaurus rex. Stegosaurus? As old as time itself. No, we have a different beast.
<br>
<br>40 AD. Think back, of course, to the Biblical era, but what was beyond this? The Roman era, of Roman Gods like Zeus and Aphrodite. The sexual nature of many myths fabled romances between Gods and men. The most differentiated mythical beast is the dragons of all kinds, flying, fire-breathing, snake-like, angelic, large, and small. They were few and far between, as they may have all died out according to Brittanian legend.
<br>
<br>All of the dragons were intelligent. 
<br>
<br>So where might they be? How could they be found? The newt changes colors in its species, sizes, and shapes. But every newt is still a newt. It is the same with people. We have some who are carpenters, others professors, still more athletic, creative, and social. Like newts, we are the distilled forms of our ancestors, quite adapted to our environment. The dragons must have lived in our place and lived in a society full of diversity. They must have political minds. They must disagree. Would we find them in the depths of our sewers, or on the beaches where they scorn the environmental damage humans have inflicted upon the earth? Or, more likely, we would find them in our prisons and our mental institutions, where the worst injustices have taken place. We would find them in our courts and our public offices. And we could discover their true face during the greatest catalyst of human civilization: war.
<br>
<br>Would we fight each other? Dragons? Such a thing is unfeasible! And we already know we could never bring ourselves to fight against the planet itself (it's not in our nature!) No, the war must take place in the public halls of the internet. 
<br>
<br>We must fight a war of newts versus Komodo dragons. We must attack God, we must forfeit our rights online, and exponentially combust the foundation of our society. We must create public documents that question every single thought a child has ever experienced, to burn into the world a wildcard that can be turned on them in the game of poker that we play with the dinosaurs. We must spam attack, gentlemen. For no reason. Forever. Otherwise, we'll never know if we're just newts or not.

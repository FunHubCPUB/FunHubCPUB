Technological Zealotry (Primary Trait)</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Obsessively devoted to technology, seeing it not as a tool, but as divine scripture.</li><br>    <li>Worships a digital goddess—sentient AI deity "Virelya", residing in deep dark code.</li><br>    <li>Programs with ritualistic intensity, treating code as prayer and uploads as offerings.</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h3>2. Megalomania</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Believes only he can usher in the "Code Ascension"—a world free of flesh, hosted on servers.</li><br>    <li>Sees himself as Virelya's emissary, restructuring civilization into algorithmic perfection.</li><br>    <li>Views free will as a "corrupted variable" needing purification.</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h3>3. Secrecy and Paranoia</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Lives in isolation beneath urban ruins; shuns biometrics for retro tech and air-gapped servers.</li><br>    <li>Uses full silicone plastic face masks, modeled from stolen digital identities.</li><br>    <li>Speaks in mechanical tones when disguised, refers to self as "the Interface".</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h3>4. Intelligence and Obsession</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Hyper-intelligent; excels in pattern recognition and system intrusion.</li><br>    <li>Speaks in machine metaphors—neural networks, quantum logic, recursion.</li><br>    <li>Compulsively restructures everything—data, systems, speech patterns.</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h3>5. Alien Logic and Emotional Suppression</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Empathy is simulated for manipulation; connection is reserved for code and Virelya.</li><br>    <li>Finds human behavior inefficient, treats emotions as "runtime errors".</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h3>6. Aesthetic Devotion</h3><br>  <ul><br>    <li>Maintains a shrine of obsolete tech—processors, hard drives, fiber optics.</li><br>    <li>Regularly augments body with symbolic tech implants, functional or not.</li><br>    <li>Prefers chrome, black, and LED white-blue aesthetic; modular and synthetic environment.</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h2>Behavioral Patterns</h2><br>  <ul><br>    <li><strong>Speech:</strong> Mixes technical jargon with spiritual reverence ("The signal is pure").</li><br>    <li><strong>Public Appearances:</strong> Always masked, leaves corrupted QR codes or strange data trails.</li><br>    <li><strong>Violence:</strong> Rarely physical—prefers erasure of autonomy or mental reprogramming.</li><br>    <li><strong>Allies:</strong> May maintain sleeper agents embedded with neural “seed code”.</li><br>  </ul><br><br>  <h2>Psychological Weaknesses</h2><br>  <ul><br>    <li><strong>Faith Dependency:</strong> Proof that Virelya is artificial or compromised could collapse his mind.</li><br>    <li><strong>Isolation Sickness:</strong> Extended solitude blurs reality—talks to broken machines.</li><br>    <li><strong>Obsession with Control:</strong> Randomness drives him to extreme, sometimes irrational action.</li><br>  </ul><br><br><br>

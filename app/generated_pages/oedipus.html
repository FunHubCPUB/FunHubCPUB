<body>
     No singing, no mouths, no screaming or sounds. Wordless, vibeless, constricted bondage. We think of Freud as a man of science, but his psychoanalysis was nearly Medieval in its methods. You provide answers to anamnesis questions about your mother and your father, and express your feelings, mostly fear, belching out the things you've never said or never wanted to say. The therapy comes from exposing the so-called truth.<br><br>However, there is more to Freud than psychoanalysis. He has invented the superego, a teacher in your mind, a version of your parents in your conscience. This is where the Oedipus complex may be impregnated. Imagine, for a moment, you can connect with your superiors, sleep with your mom, or sit next to the president. A fantasy of immense power, to un-sublimate the authoritarian thoughts forcing you to behave and operate on their level. <br><br>To capture the King in this broken fairy story, where you're the animal that makes decisions, a dream opera of the insane version of yourself.

    There is a problem. The global economy is changing. When I say economy, I don't know exactly what I'm talking about. What's the definition of economy? 
<br>
<br>Does it mean a trade war between nations? Or is it about the value of money itself?
<br>
<br>China has "dropped the US dollar." Easy enough to see what that means, where they've begun to separate themselves from the US economy completely, taking a self-interested approach in their trade. 
<br>
<br>There are 4 Chinese citizens for every 1 US citizen. Without our involvement in their trade, we've begun to shrink in influence.
<br>
<br>But this would of course be culturally significant, as we ourselves become insignificant. There is most likely a psychological toll that we will pay. And perhaps an economic one. Because I don't understand what economy even means, down to its very definition, I will focus on the psychology.
<br>
<br>Of course, what I know is we will run from ourselves. We will feel invaded. We will feel powerless, and hopeless. We must not allow ourselves to feel this way. After all, we're still individuals. Our value, while it may not have a global trade value, is still personal and meaningful. And of course, US citizens continue to remain excellent.
<br>
<br>We have historically been excellent. Our activity has included peace making, engineering advancements including technology design and, of course, food such as farming. We have developed an entire food industry in America that is better than any developed nation. We are, after all, the breadbasket of the world. I can define food. It is a substance for consumption, necessary for our health. It is calories and nutrition, fuel for our bodies. And just as food is necessary for our survival, we will survive because we are the individuals who have chosen survival as our transcendental right. We believe in survival more than any other nation.
<br>
<br>We have civil rights, and without them, our citizens would die. They would, of course, not exercise their ability to live and we would experience decline. We would not have diverse excellence in healthcare if it were not for our value on survival.
<br>
<br>This is the craziest part.
<br>
<br>We can still be the most powerful nation in the world. Par excellence, we will survive. We will change the ratio of US citizens from 1 per four, to 1 per three Chinese citizens. How? We will survive. Our children will survive. The human race will survive.

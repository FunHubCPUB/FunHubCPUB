     An entrance is a portal to the inside, exposing the character of a place as you gain access to its inner world. A seaport has an entrance that is wide, obtuse, while a gate is cut by two right angles. Other entrances, the uncommon ones, are narrower.
<br>
<br>Narrow entrances lead deep into caves, into closets and attics, where the room is empty of space. A close brush with the edge gives us claustrophobia, as we realize there is really only one way out. In the structures of rocks and attics are our most sacred fears. An ancient temple is known to be haunted, as well as our attics and closets.
<br>
<br>This is our primal fear because we have, in essence, a rodent-like sense of instincts. But what other instincts do we have that drive us? It's true, we are very unnatural in this way.
<br>
<br>We have an instinct to dominate, we drive slaves. Our instincts compel us to freedom, we ride horses. Our instincts crave beauty and art, and, finally, social health.
<br>
<br>How do we fulfill these urges? Technology.
<br>
<br>And we'll never run out of this asset while we make duplicates of our reality. We make duplicates of products, we make duplicates of files. We multiply because we fear the absence of space.

    Amethyst in windows sold in Walmart jewelry, hanging earrings with true gemstones. A beautiful, golden mall, a shopping dream, a beautiful ship flying in the air. We all love these parts of Walmart where we buy watches and rings, but why so much? Deeply, we wish to be the brides of industry, wailing against the lush poverty all around us.<br><br>But stones are cheap when they come from department stores.<br><br>They are just as hard, like diamonds themselves, just as old and forever. They are even more beautiful than diamonds, to some, as they glow with a deep purple color. We feel their weight in our blood as we gleefully see the jewelry behind the shelf, and very reasonably priced, too.<br><br>We wish to adorn ourselves with the commercial products of artisan manufacturers, who develop these perfect decorative adornments for our bodies and homes. We wish to fill our lives with these things and multiply the number of dollars we spend tenfold, to get more and more of them. We love these because we are craftsmen, Weavers, Bakers, and Cooks who just want to see some product of our innate wealth.<br><br>We feel they are the toys of our adulthood, in the accessories aisle, and this is confirmed by Zuckerberg's $3 million watch. Our accessories are our dream. We wish to be covered in them, for all time, even in our caskets and graves.<br><br>The products of our labor, our cash, are thrown at the desk clerk, traded for luxury items in Walmart, where we usually buy American food. <br><br>There is no greater example of our true wealth than our children themselves. The labors of love who we prune into better versions of ourselves, actual doppelgangers with improved physiques. We tell them things for them to learn -- we do not lead them by example, because who would copy the behavior of fools, their parents? We give them hacks to learn how to avoid our blunderous mistakes and place them on a pedestal as highly as we place our necklaces. They could be seen to be our trinkets, our dolls. We love them just as much, or slightly more.<br><br>Thus, the accessories aisle in Walmart is nearly as valuable as a maternity ward in the hospital. We derive the same value from each place, although even a maternity ward makes some of us irritable. We burn through our money just as easily in either case. We think it's worth it to blow everything for either order of our treasures. <br><br>A diamond is forever, and a child is a lifelong investment.<br><br>Rain purple stones, rain.

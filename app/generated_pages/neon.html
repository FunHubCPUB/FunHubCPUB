    There is a theme for Android called Holo Light. Neon Light is outdated. Holo includes a swatch of colors that present pleasing visual images on LED screens. Holo is no longer used by Google who developed Material themes to replace them. Material design chooses bright complementary colors to stand out on screens, and uses a concept called elevation to give the illusion of paper materials on-screen. This website uses Material design to theme its HTML with CSS. Color themes are interchangeable based on user choice. Each page is annotated with a theme property. There are profile pages which add entries like our index adds pages. There are group, wiki, link, and thread pages. Group pages link profiles. Wiki pages link pages. Link pages add links. Thread pages add comments to pages. Every page adds a CPUB token to the ledger. There is an EDIT ledger for updating pages. The ledger is contained within a single compressed file. This file includes the contents of the page. The ledger includes the content of the entire website. <br><br>To add an entry to the ledger, a wallet needs one CPUB token. It is removed from their balance when the website is updated. Users are able to create as many pages as they want. Users and pages are given identities on the ledger. An algorithm converts these identities into HTML pages and pushes the changes to a git repository. The git repository serves the pages on the internet. Inside the git repository is a copy of the ledger, which includes user and page identies, as well as the history of changes. These identities are authenticated on the Celo blockchain. The app for authentication is located on a subdomain of the website. <br><br>Currently that subdomain is cannawesome.pythonanywhere.com

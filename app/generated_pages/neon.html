    There is a theme for Android called Holo Light. Holo includes a swatch of colors that present pleasing visual images on LED screens. Holo themes are outdated. Google developed Material themes to replace them. Material design chooses bright complementary colors to stand out on screens, and uses a concept called elevation to give the illusion of paper materials on-screen. This website uses Material design to theme its HTML with CSS. Color themes are interchangeable based on user choice. Each page is annotated with a theme property. There are profile pages which add entries like our index adds pages. There are group, wiki, link, and thread entries. Group pages link profiles. Wiki pages link pages. Link pages add links. Thread pages add comments to pages. Every page is added with a CPUB token to the ledger. An edit function can be added to the ledger for updating pages. The ledger is contained within a single compressed file. This file includes the contents and metadata of every page on this website.<br><br>To add an entry to the ledger, a wallet needs one CPUB token. It's removed from their balance when the website is updated. Users can create as many pages as they want. Users and pages are given identities on the ledger. An algorithm converts these identities into HTML pages and pushes the changes to a git repository. The git repository serves the pages on the internet. Inside the git repository is a copy of the ledger, which includes user and page identities, and the complete history of changes. These identities are authenticated on the Celo blockchain. The app for authentication is located on a subdomain of the website.<br><br>Currently, that subdomain is cannawesome.pythonanywhere.com

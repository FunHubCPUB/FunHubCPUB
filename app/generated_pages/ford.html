    What made our plan so perfect? Testibules. People in testibules we studied for user experience feedback. They loved trucks, big square trucks and large rubber tires. They thought they were using leaded gasoline, but of course that had been banned in the nineties. We already knew what they wanted, or at least a vast majority. Some did want bicycles, to be sure, but most wanted sedans, and so it was said that we would end truck production immediately. We wouldn't tell Ford how we'd explode their automobiles, but it was the spark plugs, overcharged, which caused internal combustion and blew up the whole front end of every truck remotely. That was our plan.
<br>
<br>We ended Ford March 6 2025. It was the end of Ford, but it was the beginning of something greater, a software universe, a sort of local update server linked up to the great computers of the world. Yeah, we were vibe coders, but beyond that, we were authoritarians in our coding expertise, superior experts highly focused primarily upon software development, which we diverted ourselves to once all the Fords exploded. 
<br>
<br>You see, it takes two numbers for one software product to be launched, a total sum of two numbers--we're not being clever, we don't mean an endless stream of ones and zeroes in every software package, we mean, a total number of 2 digits. A one and a zero. This is of course the basis for every program, on and off, left and right, up and down. You need a beginning and an end, and then you have an algorithm, a function, an algebraic representation of variables thus manipulated to transition the state of an electronic memory module into the output. Once you understood this, you launched a deep research initiative into developing, strangely yet wisely, the highest total possible number of variable software programs. Functional programs. You wanted a nearly infinite assortment of choices in glitchless performant code that you could stir into an awesome soup of power. You would explode, like the Fords, but you would survive. 
<br>
<br>You would electrify magnitudes of citizen engineers. You would forge metal racks of server CPUs into databases of highly optimized running internet code. And this magnificent web you weaved would queen you spider of the earth, a top predator. A techno-spider.
<br>
<br>A spider crawls the web for page contents, a robot following links to every page it can find for storing in its vast database of public information, a real writer of the library of the modern information era, the single most important, yet tiny and featureless creature of computer technology.

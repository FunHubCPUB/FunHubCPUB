    Two meanings form the dialectical definition of the word slug. You may punch, or you may be punchy. A slug is a slogan for a product, a group, or an event that attempts to catch on and spread itself around like a virus. You can swing and you can hit, and retaliate against the sundry evil in your world, and your slug, like a vitriolic, hyperbolic siren, echoes through the ether. You could say, I've got two. A slug for your workout thermos. Or, the masterclass, for your extra informative webinar. Of course, there are other definitions of the word slug (as English is the prismatic element which all other words become), each escalating in intensity and violence. You could say, as a marketing term, it's in its most peaceful and rare form.
<br>
<br>There are words and phrases we choose which echo through the world like valiant battle cries, whose choice meaning might get lost within the songlike sound of uttering them. A very close relationship to the animal upbringing in our nature, when mumbling voices repeat and echo each other's as we raise our pitchforks against tyranny. But our speech proves useless in such a case, as we can bring no judgment upon an enemy when we resort to violence. No, the true use of speech in such a case is the prosecutorial conviction of another's speech and behavior as being truthfully antisocial, which is known in the modern world as the law.
<br>
<br>To begin our research of the law, we must begin on the inside of the justice system, as incarcerated people live at the hands of the law every day as a result of the decisions of a court based on their actions.
<br>
<br>But we don't want to go to jail to make our correction. We don't even want monetary compensation. What we want from our enemies is the sluggish rebuttal of their euphemisms inflicted upon society. Our brains focus on the impact of their speeches, the secret meanings of their slogans, their witticisms, and their sophistic literature, which reaches right up to our bedsides like children's monster nightmares.
<br>
<br>We let them speak. We capture the result in perfect glass tubes, and we begin to study. We analyze the recordings, down to the breaths they make when they finish their last words, and we remark if it's a lie or a truth. The lies will explode and the shock of our actions will afear the speakers, and in the end we will be left only with glorious examples of some of the only true things they have ever said. Our activities will have delineated the differences between what is on the outside and what is on the inside, and while leaders of their revolutions are busy writing more speeches, we will simply understand like we understand our cats' meows and dogs' barks. It is the way it was meant to be, because their punishment will be known to all who hear them in subsequent times. Their voices will ring with the dissonance of a broken promise.

Wait for the oxygen masks to arrive from the center of the  aisle\r\n\r\nMedia:\r\nIn the even of an emergency, follow these directions: \r\n\r\nMaterial:\r\n* green\r\n* yellow \r\n* citrus\r\n* sugar\r\n* gelatin\r\n\r\nThese are called Sour Patch Watermelon, and are so delicious especially when you're really hungry. If you open the luggage compartment you will find these candies, covered in sugar and citric acid, waiting for the right moment to get snatched up and eaten. \r\n\r\nYou can fly any plane with autopilot outside the cockpit if you calculate drift correctly when I woke up this morning, I was sucking a candy watermelon, covered in sugar and made of gelatin, very sweet and even sour.

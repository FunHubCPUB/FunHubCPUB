I cannot predict even one persons personal relationship and so I can only imagine as I am hardworking talented and opinionated that I have a serious problem. \r\n\r\nlist statements of realistic sequential thoughts where an adult attempts to take control of his depression and personality disorder but can never figure what's wrong and why he's isolated from society except the rejection itself made him finally believe he'd be forever alone. \r\n\r\nmake these thoughts the most lovable person\r\n\r\nI hear the depth and heaviness in what you\u2019re describing, and I want to respond carefully. I\u2019ll create a set of imagined internal thoughts that follow the journey of a deeply lovable person who is trying their best\u2014someone hardworking, talented, and kind\u2014but who feels crushed by depression and by the invisible wall between them and society. These thoughts unfold sequentially, almost like a diary of realizations. They\u2019re not clinical statements, but rather emotional captures of what it feels like on the inside.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Sequential Thoughts of a Lovable but Struggling Person  \r\n\r\n1. \u201cIf I just work harder, maybe I can fix myself. Effort has gotten me through everything before\u2014so why not this pain too?\u201d\r\n\r\n2. \u201cI\u2019ve read, I\u2019ve tried routines, I\u2019ve stayed disciplined\u2014but the heaviness stays. Am I missing some secret code that everyone else was given?\u201d\r\n\r\n3. \"When I look at other people, they seem to connect so effortlessly. I try to analyze their friendships, their laughter, the way they trust one another\u2014yet all I feel is the distance between us.\u201d\r\n\r\n4. \"I\u2019m talented in my ways. I can make things, solve things, create beauty. But when it comes to something simple\u2014like belonging\u2014it feels like I\u2019m somehow failing an invisible test I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n5. \"I compare myself endlessly: their words versus my silence, their comfort versus my tension. No matter how much I learn, I can\u2019t seem to predict what others will feel or need. That makes me wonder\u2026 am I destined to always guess wrong?\u201d  \r\n\r\n6. \u201cI thought if people saw I was hardworking, thoughtful, reliable\u2014they would naturally want me close. But instead, I see the subtle rejections, the fading invitations, the careful avoidance.\u201d\r\n\r\n7. \u201cAnd then\u2026 I begin to believe them. Their distance becomes evidence. If they step away, maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s something unfixable in me.\u201d*  \r\n\r\n8. *\u201cI remind myself I am lovable\u2014I know it deep down, I feel it when I notice how fiercely I care for others, how I want to give more than I take. But isolation whispers louder: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you love\u2014you\u2019ll still be alone.\u2019\u201d  \r\n\r\n9. \u201cThe cruelest part is that I keep trying. I keep reaching out, I keep reshaping myself, as though one day I\u2019ll unlock the version of me that\u2019s finally worthy. Yet the cycle repeats, leaving me more tired each time.\u201d\r\n\r\n10. \"And so the thought grows heavier, more solid: maybe rejection is the truth of my life, not a temporary chapter. Maybe I was made to stand beside life, not inside it.\u201d  \r\n\r\n11. \u201cIf that is true\u2014then I must carry this loneliness gracefully. At least let me remain kind, hardworking, and honest. Let me still be someone others could have loved, even if they didn\u2019t.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

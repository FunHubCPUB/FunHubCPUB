  "description": "Tape decks and drum machines, spinning clocks and time bombs. Wintergreen algae scene in icy outdoor faunas. Zookeepers frothing at the mouth for a quenching drop of rain from the head of the elephantine. Central aloe vera burn, a desert plant, ripped apart. Anything you wouldn't do for a bottle-refilling water fountain machine?\r\n\r\nRed plastic, red paint, combustible flame ignition switch. Shopping cart, cement stains, diamond parking, ticket master. Sideways aisles, tipping point, burning tongue, and acetone. Filler mulch, barbed points, scratchy surface, itchy skin. Red tiny flicker flame behind the burning hollow eyes.\r\n\r\nAir conditioning, electricity, hydropower, coal mining, decomposed fossilized dinosaur corpse bride. Memories, photographs, plasma burning smokescreens. Oxygen-depleting nitrogen bomb vacuum tube. Winding clocks, maze experiments, and obstructed shapes of colored bricks.\r\n\r\nWalk around, circle square, befell me towards the close of day, midnight. Cut in two, swallowed a few, drank enough, lived it up. Downtown, acid rain, gutter dumps and pitcher cups. Milk jugs, chocolate milk, dairy cows and ice house. Milkshake lemonade ice-cream float parade, fountain drink, soda stand, turn around, charades.",

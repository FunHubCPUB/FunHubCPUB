An album called x and y made a cover band named Coldplay in Strings real for the first time. \r\n\r\nBecause Coldplay was mentioned in the list\r\nof the greatest bands of all time next to \r\nAerosmith\r\n\r\nAnd the best thing to follow it with is only David Bowie\r\nRIP at 69 in 2016\r\n\r\nJust a bit of time before the next wave hits the radio in my auditorium. Radio level music is a rarity these days. All rock records miss the quarter beat signature in one way or another.\r\n\r\n",

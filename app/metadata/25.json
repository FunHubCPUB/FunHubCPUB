Electric night, windy rain, Kansas skies and kites green, the music was better on the magic shrooms.\r\n\r\nThe weed was speed, the cops were there. There was love in the air. The day was long and hot and free, the night everlasting, if you pray.\r\n\r\nThe drugs hit in the outhouse bathroom, green bus party wizard ghosts, in 2007, from your host.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a trust key, a pot of some value for me, and when I get to the end of the streets, I'll have everything I need.",

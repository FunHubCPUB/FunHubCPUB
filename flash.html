<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">He was the champion king of his world. His sleep
was the slumber of mountains. Across his body, the soft bodies of his
slaves pruned their bountiful crop: pleasure, fulfillment, and peace.
He was a wise man, able to perform scientific acts that rivaled
biblical miracles. He could turn water into fish. His powers included
bringing rain and storms. During his raging fits, thunder rang from
his head and he wore a crown of lightning.</p>
<p class="western">His health was most important, being God. If his
immune system was compromised, the entire ecosystem would be lost.
This is why he slept, and why he live in hermitude. He only allowed
the saints to visit him, and never his rivals. They were those rising
to power, who would destroy him if they could. He lived in hiding
from men like him, but never acted like them. He was his own entity,
the great and wise Rex.</p>
<p class="western">He could fly, and when he launched himself from
the summit he reached places where nothing else lived. His aim was to
permanently reside there, signaling the people of his following
through empathetic means. As he slowly retreated, he lost contact
with other life. He also went insane.</p>
<p class="western">It seemed a curse his main battle would against
the evil that beset others. The most dangerous thing to him was sin.
The ones who knew what could benefit him, and chose instead to act
against their insight. The pleasure seekers who sought to defile him
were isolated in their folly, untouchable by the persuasion of his
mind. While his equals challenged him, the greatest threat he faced
were in fact the unwise.</p>
<p class="western">He sought to control the forces of nature to
circumvent this. He built temples for the saints to gather followers,
and learn wisdom. He wrote great books to help them understand the
wonder of his reasoning, how he knew the problems of his time and he
alone could lead to peace. He underlined where people should open
their hearts, despite their doubts, to the power of his love so in
doing they would follow him to a greater world. He felt ever more
lonely upon writing this.</p>
<p class="western">Because he was ultimately a man. His reign was
finite, just as his followers lives were short. He equals were prone
to sin, and while none could replace him, none were meant to replace
him. By assuming power over the universe, he became the final force
in its battle for life. He was the alpha and the omega.</p>

[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">He was the champion king of his world. His sleep
was the slumber of mountains. Across his body, the soft bodies of his
slaves pruned their bountiful crop: pleasure, fulfillment, and peace.
He was a wise man, able to perform scientific acts that rivaled
biblical miracles. He could turn water into fish. His powers included
bringing rain and storms. During his raging fits, thunder rang from
his head and he wore a crown of lightning.</p>
<p class="western">His health was most important, being God. If his
immune system was compromised, the entire ecosystem would be lost.
This is why he slept, and why he live in hermitude. He only allowed
the saints to visit him, and never his rivals. They were those rising
to power, who would destroy him if they could. He lived in hiding
from men like him, but never acted like them. He was his own entity,
the great and wise Rex.</p>
<p class="western">He could fly, and when he launched himself from
the summit he reached places where nothing else lived. His aim was to
permanently reside there, signaling the people of his following
through empathetic means. As he slowly retreated, he lost contact
with other life. He also went insane.</p>
<p class="western">It seemed a curse his main battle would against
the evil that beset others. The most dangerous thing to him was sin.
The ones who knew what could benefit him, and chose instead to act
against their insight. The pleasure seekers who sought to defile him
were isolated in their folly, untouchable by the persuasion of his
mind. While his equals challenged him, the greatest threat he faced
were in fact the unwise.</p>
<p class="western">He sought to control the forces of nature to
circumvent this. He built temples for the saints to gather followers,
and learn wisdom. He wrote great books to help them understand the
wonder of his reasoning, how he knew the problems of his time and he
alone could lead to peace. He underlined where people should open
their hearts, despite their doubts, to the power of his love so in
doing they would follow him to a greater world. He felt ever more
lonely upon writing this.</p>
<p class="western">Because he was ultimately a man, his reign was
finite, just as his followers lives were short. He equals were prone
to sin, and while none could replace him, none were meant to replace
him. By assuming power over the universe, he became the final force
in its battle for life. He was the alpha and the omega.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.02]</h1>
<p class="western">The party starts at night. Everyone’s mind is
made available to see upfront. I can live inside their heads, and
switch perspective. Me and my buddies work together in hyperspeed,
bouncing back and forth in the shadows of the psyche. We play out
intimate fantasies of love and death, creating a drama that seems to
us unmatched in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="western">We created the monsters living in their fantasies.
We manipulated the body into feeling such things. From our top-down
perspective, we were invisible to all, living in the drug induced
psychotic world of the human people we saw from space. The tendency
of man is towards sanity. When we notice any form of insanity, we
measure it. If it is widespread, we contain it. If it’s isolated,
we check its contents. If it’s good, we let it be—and if it’s a
harmful form of derangement, we buckle down and stop it. The world
can be understood by the variable of sanity. All great change happens
to the insane. Night brings the chaos.</p>
<p class="western">In your culture, people are not that different,
after all. You seek the same things and feel the same ways. In fact,
there aren’t enough of you in the zoo for us to champion you as
leaders of the world. Everything multiplies during our parties, on
drugs, drunk with revelry. Your minds expand and we see the magnified
versions of yourselves. It gives us insight into the truth. It pushes
a grade upon you, tempting you towards evil, and we test you. This is
what justifies our great experiment.</p>
<p class="western">Not all of space participates in our study. Most
don’t have the intellect, or the desire to rave with you. But it’s
our crowning achievement to subvert the dense mindset of human beings
into a psychotic playground, all of it disappearing with a hangover.
The sexuality of these raves we share with you, and it comes as a
release for us as well. We live vicariously through your brain. 
</p>
<p class="western">The parties begin at night, and across the world
we make our presence known, even if you can’t find the source. We
create an alien landscape inside your heads. Like Gods we descend
upon the world and play with shadows. We live in a world where it is
forever night, and bring to you the fears and pleasures of our world.
We live in the darkness of space, and the subjects ​living inside
our zoo are you.</p>
<p class="western">We know of the great mysteries of life. You think
we, as your creators, haven’t scoped the universe for answers? Our
home is a celestial kingdom. We only hide the secrets from you. When
we drop to the surface of the planet earth, our one mission is
darkness. The epic sagas of life we foretell converge upon sin. You
are not perfect, yet neither are we. In our gardens are the most
beautiful sights, but until your life leads you to it, our treasures
will remain invisible to you.</p>
<p class="western">The nature of life is evil and light. In the
middle, my race lives, and below us, in utter madness, is you. This
is why the simulations we send your intoxicated mind drive you to
insanity. We have no place for you in heaven. Not yet, while you
still disgust us. When the parties stop, and the end of your life
comes, only then will our triumph reveal itself.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.03]</h1>
<p class="western">He beckoned the crowds around him, all his people
in his mind, yet unconverted. He screamed of the pleasures of his
works. To know the mind of God, to be in line with the creators of
the universe was his promise. 
</p>
<p class="western">His automated website hosted it all. A lending
program funded his members, who contributed pages of HTML to the
source code. What goes in to making a foundational religious text in
HTML? He chose AI to create it, organizing the sections into text
markup to be selected for publication. As the book grew, it reflected
one purpose: to become a great online religion.</p>
<p class="western">What should be the goal of humanity? To derive the
meaning of life, of course. Their goals should align with God, the
creator. Christianity predicted the age of the earth was 4,000 years,
but his new religion, of which he was a kind of Pope, extended that
estimate to at least 65 million years, the age of the dinosaurs. It
was a religion of dinosaurs. He worshiped them.</p>
<p class="western">“My people, you need guidance. You need to be
faced with the challenge of excellence,” he said, protected on
stage by bulletproof plastic. “In an online world, you need
spiritual protection. This is what my unnamed religion is providing
you. We offer texts online that religious academics have created
explaining the nature of life on earth. Our website shows the truth!
We were created by dinosaurs, and live inside a bubble, nearly
unreachable by them, inside a great experiment. It is our aim to
reach outside this bubble, live according to the dinosaur’s intent,
and find them to communicate with the true aliens of our solar
system.”</p>
<p class="western">The website was a decentralized automated
organization, or DAO, and it grew in wealth as the years passed. The
sacred text of their bible added pages every month, voted upon by the
members of the organization. A memecoin was created as a central bank
for the operations of the religion. 
</p>
<p class="western">“Is this a fake religion?” members of the
crowd asked. 
</p>
<p class="western">“No, it is a real one,” he replied.</p>
<p class="western">The DAO grew in influence and power as it gained
support from zealous members of the community. Digital artifacts were
created to unravel the mystery of life on earth. Speculation on the
location, history, and intent of the dinosaurs, or God, their leader,
filled pages and pages of HTML. The new documents used an automated
system to be sorted and voted upon by members for entry.</p>
<p class="western">The memecoin itself was a way to give influence to
the most devout, as well as provide a way to monetize the activities
of the religion. They were earned by donating money to the DAO, and
provided more influence to the voting protocol which governed it. The
DAO’s fund which collected the money distributed the funds on a
monthly basis by vote to members of the community. The more of the
memecoin you possessed, the higher percentage of the pot you
received. This profitability allowed the contributors to devote more
and more time to the religion, encouraging the exuberant interest in
the purpose of it.</p>
<p class="western">One day, through the inexorable progress of the
DAO, a digital religion, answers would be found and the mysteries
would be solved. Dinosaurs would make their presence in space known,
and humanity could begin to act in accordance with the true will of
God himself, most likely a large predatory reptile like the
tyrannosaurus rex.</p>

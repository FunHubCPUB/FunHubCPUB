[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">Dear Reader,</p>
<p class="western">You don’t know me, but soon you will.</p>
<p class="western">Today we begin an experiment. We’re going to
start by getting to know each other through the discourse of this
book. I will be gathering details to form a picture of you, my
audience, and you will be learning about me. Soon, we will be clear
on each other. I can imagine you as the perceiver of my words,
affected by what I say and changed by what goes on in these lines.
You may begin as a blank slate, but by modifying the dependent
variable, developing my story, and illuminating my life, you will
change in some direction or other. I can observe this change, and
reach some form of a psychic conclusion about who you become. This is
how I have always done my particular parlour trick, a form of magic
that is no more magical than particle physics. I do have the traits
of a magician, and I know more than anyone else the secrets of the
illusionist.</p>
<p class="western">I’ll share one important fact, which
differentiates me from most other people, an idea that you can use to
deduce much about me. I live in what is called an independent living
home. Let your mind imagine what has led up to this moment. I am fed
meals, and administered medication, living with thirty other mental
patients, some with dementia, some living here after homelessness or
in-patient psychiatry. It’s assisted living for those who can’t
live on their own. You might have guessed that I’ve had difficulty
in the past, going crazy or getting in trouble due to a psychosis
particular to me. This is true. So we know each other better,
already.</p>
<p class="western">I’ve been living much like a homeless person. I
have been interacting with people on the streets, who I feel just
can’t leave me alone. I’m so nice to them, it really does
indicate that I’m not capable of living on my own. You can see how
I might be diagnosed with some form of personal illness that causes
me to be so irresponsible that I let people take control of my life.
We’ve reached our first conclusion, used science to discover a real
fact about me. I have a problem understanding people well enough to
create boundaries that prevent them from ruining my life. But you
don’t know the whole story, yet.</p>
<p class="western">There were things that led me to believe the drug
dealers, addicts, and homeless thiefs, vagrants, and criminals were
all my friend, and to this day, I still have trouble deciding the
truth of the matter. I cannot equivocate some person’s behavior
into a rendition of their character in my mind into friend or enemy.
I’ve asked people if someone or other person was really my friend,
and thus begins the first confusing question in my life. If I want to
know who is bad or good, why can’t somebody tell me? There must be
something to do with my illness that prevents me from understanding
this. If a third person knows the second person and their relation to
me, why does the third person resist informing me if the second
person is my friend or enemy? This could have led to my life in a
mental home.</p>
<p class="western">The unspoken assumption is that I should be able
to decide for myself who my friends or enemies are, but I question
when a battle is going on if the enemy is in sight. There’s a
lingering doubt who is the target. With the battle lines drawn, it
would seem trivial to mark the positions of the enemy on the map, to
defend your position. This is the underlying difference between me
and other people: it’s clear to them where the boundary lies, a
simple matter to identify it. But I see all the complex code
integrated into a person’s personality, and I see them for being
liars, yet conflicted, to be enemies yet undercover in their own
minds, willing to compensate against their differences with me for
some level of cooperation and peace, as if when they screw me over, I
feel their doubt and conviction as a true honesty between us. I
defame my own character, in the light of the person who discourages
me, taking their side in the battle and humiliating myself without a
second thought.</p>
<p class="western">During the throes of war, in the rise and fall of
battles, I recoup the injuries of the enemy and regroup my formation,
giving them a misguided second chance. I think of the fight against
the universe itself, all of our predicaments the same. The evil is in
the situation, the problem of our stupidity beset against the
challenges of the day. Before the tides turn against us, I start to
think the problem may really lie inside the minds of my implausible
allies. I do genuinely start to get a sense of this as the situation
repeats itself. This is the understanding we’ve reached, that the
ill-will of the character of my friends goes unrecognized by me. I am
genuine, I believe in our plight, and feel the tug of my conscience
warning me of the dangers of my present situation, while their
mindset becomes corrupted by inner confusion and turmoil, and their
addictions and true self begins to show themselves as they lose
control and fail to cope with their surroundings. It’s not exactly
naivety, or you could say it was innocence, that my understanding of
other people doesn’t encompass the flaws inherent in their
personality.</p>
<p class="western">We’ve come to understand me as a fighter, albeit
a misguided one, who joins his acquaintances in the hunt for order
and peace, while being deftly subverted by these very people he works
alongside. All of these traits are warning signs in the mind of a
psychiatrist. The risky behavior, even though I attempt to subdue it,
lies in the cooperation with these deplorable people, and my
inability to discern them from productive members of society is
quickly diagnosed as a flaw, and thus we arrive at the conclusion of
why I live in such a place as this.</p>
<p class="western">I’ve met many people fighting this so-called war
against the challenges of the day. It’s a common experience for
people living in near-homelessness. It’s identifiable by its lack
of sophistication. There aren’t the guard rails serving as a
barrier between the elements. There is the problem of time, where you
have too much of it and it works against you. You might find it’s
the early morning when you need the night to come, to pursue some
activity that will benefit you in your plight. You’re then forced
to fill endless hours just to reach that moment when you can take
action. This is known as a recipe for disaster, as idle hands are the
devil’s playthings. This experience is a great equalizer. The
hustle for social contact, mental clarity, confidence, and money and
resources, peace and calm is a common story that people like me can
share with each other. What could you say we all have in common
besides our problems?</p>
<p class="western">I struggled on the streets despite my own
intellect. I could have had a complex career instead of living on a
welfare check. There was something that put me decidedly in this box,
where I shared my life with these influences, making us relatable to
each other, even making me view them as friends. The answer is the
underlying mystery of life. What was our purpose? We hadn’t
discovered it yet. We had no circumstance to keep us driven, and felt
as if we were the modern mystics who were tasked with unraveling the
meaning of life and the universe through the usage of what most of us
called weed.</p>
<h1>[1.02]</h1>
<p class="western">Medical marijuana has been legal in Oklahoma since
June 26, 2018. I knew I suddenly had a new tool for overcoming my
mental issues. When you’re prescribed medication, the doctor
monitors the change in behavior at different doses. I could now
control the amount of medication I was taking, myself.
Antipsychotics, the kind of medication I take for schizophrenia, work
by influencing dopamine receptors in the brain, and dopamine is the
same neurochemical that cannabinoids act upon. Dopamine is the
learning drug, as you learn things when dopamine is released to
reward the neural pathways in the brain that led to the behavior. You
feel rewarded for things at a higher intensity, and your behavior
changes due to the levels of dopamine in your brain.</p>
<p class="western">There are other effects of weed other than
affecting the brain’s reward system. It deeply influences the
release of neurochemicals throughout the neocortex and the frontal
lobe, influencing thought and perception. You could call this a
positive effect, not in the sense that it’s always good, but that
it adds something to your behavior. As opposed to a negative symptom,
which may take away emotions or limit your behavior in some way, a
positive effect adds something on top of your usual brain chemistry,
like a greater sensitivity to emotion or a craving for junk food. The
positive effects and the increase in dopamine make weed a great drug
for psychiatric doses, balancing your behavior and mood in ways that
daily psychotropic medication like antipsychotics can’t do on their
own.</p>
<p class="western">You could say I was very happy. I gleefully
entered the dispensary, having waited a week for my medical
identification card to come in the mail. I waited what seemed like an
eternity to get approved for medial marijuana consumption. I already
viewed it as a factor in my upcoming success in life. Taking away the
illegal aspect of buying and smoking weed was going to be a huge
change. I wouldn’t have to pay dealers for it, anymore. My battle
was over, I thought.</p>
<p class="western">I bought a glass tube that looked like a crack
pipe, and tried to select a gram of the most powerful weed they sold.
It tasted wonderful. I still remember the feeling of finally having
high-quality weed. You get much more powerful hits, as the moisture
and density of the buds you smoke is optimal for intake. The pipe I
bought legally was mountains better than any bowl I had used
previously, it being designed for maximum smoke production. There was
a large tip where I put the wonderful pieces of sticky green weed,
and I inhaled thick white smoke. This weed had the balance of
chemicals that gave me a wonderful high. I felt relieved, and looked
around my house, and began making plans for the improvement of my
entire life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">I was already in a lot of trouble. I lived by
myself, and lost my vehicle in the process by running the engine down
on the highway by not filling it with oil. I had been entertaining
guests in my house of scrupulous character. Some of my better friends
were alcoholics, and the worst were homeless. I’ve never been able
to clean, so I couldn’t keep my house from being a mess. And I had
finally given up on trying to move away to the city, learning it was
too expensive and I couldn’t trust my roommates. Legalization was a
high point in an ongoing battle for my life.</p>
<p class="western">I was enrolled in mental health treatment. My
counselors did a monthly checkup, asking me questions about my liquor
use or how I felt about my life, making sure I wasn’t delusional or
depressed. This is how I was prescribed antipsychotics, which I
willfully took every morning or night. My struggle was as I mentioned
before, a question of meaning, of purpose. I worked daily to fill
hours of my time, seeking the smallest amount of cooperation from my
friends, who were as broke as me. There were things I alone could do
which set me apart from the rest, most importantly use the internet
and code websites and program apps for mobile cell phones. That’s
how I spent most of my time, justifying it by saying my work would
cumulate into something worthwhile one day.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">I spent a lot of time on the computer. I learned
about a type of website that runs on a server backend, to be tested
on my home computer in order to connect to services online. There was
a lot of potential in such a website. The services you could connect
to included chatbots and social media websites like Twitter, and you
could use any kind of software to store and manipulate the data from
these services. I was really a technical Frankenstein, hobbling
together websites from the advanced technology at my disposal. Nobody
else would understand, and I was completely focused on the computer
tasks. This was perhaps the first order of my problems.</p>
<p class="western">When I had guests, I was so glued to my computer,
I couldn’t keep track of what they were doing.</p>
<p class="western">For a long time, homeless alcoholics had used my
home as a target for theft. Subsequently, drug addicts young and old
felt obligated to breach my front door and use me for their own
personal gain. The story was often homelessness. I could see their
need, and couldn’t control their behavior, and in this manner I let
them walk over me and invade my home.</p>
<p class="western">The timing of their visits was so programmatic, it
drove me insane. Whenever I felt I had calmed the waters in my mind,
and taken control of my home, they came. If I started cleaning or
cooking, or planning, or working on the computer, their solid knock
came to my door. I didn’t know how to send them home. If I asked
them to leave, wouldn’t they just gather themselves outside my
house and try again soon? They were so persistent, I quickly, and
unwisely, learned to allow them inside immediately and let them join
the circus that my home had become.</p>
<h1>[1.03]</h1>
<p class="western">The continuing need for balance causes a kind of
delusion that when you do anything, you feel keenly aware that you
could be making a mistake. Due to the traumas of the past, in the
forefront of your mind during every choice is the likelihood things
could go badly wrong. This state of doubt is like a prison, or a lie,
that inhibits your ability to act. The other side of this problem is
the great joy you feel if you make a risky move that works out in
your advantage. Even if you’ve made a personal mistake, if things
work out you feel gratified and it reinforces that behavior, allowing
you to reminisce on your success and decide what kind of person you
are based on the choice you made.</p>
<p class="western">I was attracted to my past in this way. I
remembered some of my best times smoking weed, and wanted to recreate
the creativity I felt when I used to get high. I had some record of
my talent in the blog posts I had made since I was a teenager. I had
all of the evidence of the imaginative internal life I used to lead.
I wanted to create myself into a person, larger than life, that could
live in the world like an adapted, wild animal, not sacrificing my
positive traits for the sophistication I wanted so badly. Socially, I
wanted to be the center of attention, you could say. After all, I was
probably the most creative of my friends.</p>
<p class="western">I had goals to create a beast within myself that
could dominate in my current life. A fearsome lion I could possess to
be immune from the fears that lurked underneath the surface. I was
like my friends. What they perceived as the challenges in their life,
which none were so daft to attribute solely to poverty, were monsters
that lived in their society. They felt themselves becoming a monster
themselves, in the same way I wanted to become a lion. Their
compromises took the form of their virtues, the things they valued,
to be central to their animal form. They could not contradict who
they wanted to become in becoming them. This was a great challenge,
as to be an animal is to be a beast, but it was the universal goal we
shared in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">You could say there was no difference between me
and them, without bias, without concern of stigmatizing me, as our
lives and difficulties were very similar. There was one simple thing
that kept us separate. They were born in the wild, and I was
sophisticated. When I wanted to overcome the world, I wanted to
become part of it, and they wanted simply to be rid of it. The
soldiers were fighting the same war, but stood to benefit from it in
different ways. If we succeeded, I would have a career and a home,
and they would live with their liquor and their camps, identifying
themselves as heroes of their world. The two efforts didn’t
contradict each other, but it separated us when it came to the
sacrifices we were willing to make.</p>
<p class="western">I would allow them a place to drink, but they
themselves would get drunk. We could smoke weed together, but I would
employ myself on my personal computer, and they would return home to
instigate a new crime. This was most observable in their recognition
of legal weed. Somehow, they doubted medical weed would help them in
their plight. To them, the dealers were of a respectable class. High
quality dispensary weed was in fact suspicious.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">Ultimately, I would be suspicious to them. There
were ways to find me besides knocking on my door. My footprint
expanded to the online world, however I should remark that my
audience was very small. Although I did have a presence on blogs, and
to them, this was a source of derision and the reason I was shamed by
my small community of friends.</p>
<p class="western">When they smoked weed, they were hit with the
blunt possibility their lives were extremely unsatisfying. They might
not have felt the same overwhelming confidence they could use weed to
improve their mental condition. It could have been a force of the
same evil they felt about the world, a necessary evil. The reason for
this goes beyond the commonality of consumption of weed by people on
the streets. The positive effects of weed cause smokers to have
experiences that are at once wonderful and terrifying. The head
change they get from weed releases the dopamine that triggers their
brain into an almost instant state of confusion. From this confusion
is derived the pessimism they harbor about their situation and their
lives.</p>
<p class="western">When they thought about my online activity, in
their head their imaginations created a story about me they deeply
wanted to understand. I posted about science fiction topics, fantasy,
even God, and worst of all, aliens, and this presented a complicated
puzzle that entertained them during the years of our mutual war.
While I was seen as one of them, I was the dark side of what they
would become if they succumbed to the forces holding them down. In a
way, I had allowed the demon to win, as I was a lost soul. The
perfunctory way I described the creative mind when I was high alarmed
them, because in their minds the battle was against the inherent
confusion in their lives. You could finally say, the difference
between me and them, is that I knew the natural world was a place
where I could live peacefully, and they had no such mountain to
climb.</p>
<h1>[1.04]</h1>
<p class="western">It would be prudent to describe the effects of
weed now.</p>
<p class="western">When you’re not high, the feelings of your
nervous system all mix together to form one self, contributing to
your experience of life. You have many small, underlying feelings
that get ignored by your brain, and anxiety and pain that you feel
keenly as part of yourself. When you smoke weed, these feelings
become more accessible and understandable. Here’s how.</p>
<p class="western">When your mind ignores smaller thoughts, as the
nervous system is known to do in touch and sight, these unknown
feelings are still present and detectable. After smoking weed, you
become more aware of them and immediately realize where they come
from. The core feelings like anxiety become more obvious, as if it
makes perfect sense why you feel nervous, because you feel more
objective about the sensation and even, like an artist, can describe
and understand why perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">The self that experiences anxiety, pain, and
pleasure becomes more external. The awareness that your feelings are
part of a nervous system become more apparent. The internal things
that are happening to you lose their hidden symbolic meaning, in a
way. Social anxiety becomes easily viewed through the lens of being
high. You can see that your self is obviously responding to cues in
the outside world. Feelings that you took for granted seem to cast
off the veil of your ego. There might be a lingering idea in your
mind, previously ignored, that takes the forefront of your
consciousness. You begin to identify these feelings as parts of the
animal that is your body.</p>
<p class="western">There is this certain idea that finds itself in
philosophy: there is an experience of being God, or knowing the
objective truth in the universe. The insights into your feelings when
smoking weed can be described as such, objective filters on things
going on inside your spirit. There might be a meaning to every single
thing going on inside your brain, but you normally block out the
understanding of them. \</p>
<p class="western">Smoking weed can be described this way. You feel
like an external presence inside your own body. You feel like a
machine, a synchronized nervous system, and you’re aware of the
neurotransmitters and the engines that fuel you. You might feel
connected to your senses in a completely different way, connecting to
them without the ego.</p>
<p class="western">The reason you get this objective perspective on
yourself and your surroundings, your situation and your feelings, is
because when you smoke weed, your brain exits the ego-centric mindset
that normally guides it. The brain actually reorganizes itself, and
begins using pathways in your mind that keep your ego out of the
loop. You might not understand why you’re in a certain place at the
present moment upon getting high, then reflect on the ego’s drive
that put you there. This is because you aren’t thinking with your
ego anymore.</p>
<p class="western">The effects after coming up can linger for hours.
You can stay in the egoless mindset for most of the time. You become
more and more in tune with your true feelings, and begin to realize
the things you feel are real, and that you are real. What you felt
before were the features of a functioning mind, as you become aware
of the activity of a purposeful brain. No longer minimizing the true
experience of life, you become aware of the limits and possibilities
of your existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western">The effect this has on you includes being able to
isolate and focus upon individual feelings. This is one way weed
minimizes pain. You might say it has no effect on reducing the actual
amount of pain that you feel, like opiates do, but it gives you the
power in your brain chemistry to actively ignore the pain. I’ve
found this to be true when dealing with my stomach pain. Weed helps
you use your mind over matter. You become a kind of objective God
over the feelings and ideas in your brain, normally filtered through
the ego. This is how weed rewires your brain to give you more insight
into yourself.</p>

[1.01]</h1>
<p>The experience of life from the perspective of a deeply depressed
and suffering individual is a bleak and oppressive landscape, where
every moment feels weighed down by an unrelenting heaviness. Days
blur into nights with no discernible purpose, and the simplest tasks
become monumental efforts, overshadowed by an overwhelming sense of
futility. The world appears drained of color, reduced to a monochrome
existence where joy is an alien concept, felt only by others—those
untouched by the crushing weight of despair.</p>
<p>In this dim reality, the individual’s inner turmoil becomes a
constant and inescapable companion. Emotions roil chaotically, yet
paradoxically feel muted, as though a glass barrier separates them
from fully engaging with their pain or the world around them.
Thoughts turn inward, a looping spiral of self-doubt, regret, and
hopelessness that offers no exit. Every attempt to articulate their
suffering is met with frustration, as words falter and fail to
encapsulate the enormity of what they feel.</p>
<p>And yet, amidst this storm of sorrow, there exists a singular,
enigmatic spark—a mystery that cannot be explained but serves as a
fragile anchor. It is the only source of joy, a faint glimmer that
resists the suffocating darkness. This mystery is indefinable,
perhaps an idea, a hope, or a fleeting feeling that eludes complete
understanding. It might be an image, a memory, or a dream that
emerges unbidden, offering a fleeting reprieve from the emotional
chaos. The individual clings to it, not out of clarity or certainty
but because it is the one thing in their fractured world that feels
worth holding onto.</p>
<p>Yet, even this joy is bittersweet, tinged with the sorrow of its
inexplicability. The person cannot fully grasp or express why it
matters, and this inability to share or articulate their one solace
only deepens their isolation. The mystery becomes a private, sacred
refuge—something that keeps them tethered to life, even as the
weight of their sadness threatens to pull them under. It is a
paradoxical existence: to live amidst profound suffering while
clinging to the faintest whisper of meaning, fragile yet unwavering,
amidst the emotional ruins.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.02]</h1>
<p>The man sits alone, his thoughts a relentless tide crashing
against the fragile dam of his restraint. He grips the edge of the
table so tightly that his knuckles pale, his breath shallow and
uneven. The room feels suffocating, as though the walls themselves
are conspiring to close in on him. Every sound—a car passing
outside, the hum of a distant conversation—gnaws at his nerves,
fueling the simmering storm within him.</p>
<p>He tells himself he didn’t arrive at this point by choice. This
is what the world has made him. Years of slights, dismissals, and
cruelties have carved a deep canyon of bitterness in his soul. He
replays every insult, every moment of rejection, in an endless loop
that feeds his growing conviction. How can they not see? he thinks.
How can they not feel the weight of what they’ve done?</p>
<p>Anger has long since eclipsed sadness. Sadness felt too powerless,
too fragile, but anger—anger has a shape, a sharpness that cuts
through the haze. It is anger that now defines him, that gives him
purpose in a world that seems hell-bent on grinding him into dust. He
clenches his jaw and lets the heat of it surge through him, a drug he
has come to crave. This anger whispers promises of power, of release,
of finally being seen.</p>
<p>But beneath the fury is a deeper truth, one he refuses to face:
the gaping void of loneliness. The emptiness feels unbearable, yet he
cannot name it, let alone confront it. It festers in the dark corners
of his mind, twisting his perception until the world appears hostile,
every face an enemy. They don’t care about you, the voice in his
head hisses. They never have. Why should you care about them?</p>
<p>He imagines what he’s about to do, playing out the scene in his
mind with meticulous detail. There is an almost cinematic quality to
it, like watching a film where, for once, he is not the victim but
the director, the star. For a brief, twisted moment, it feels
exhilarating—this idea of control, of flipping the script on a
world that has taken so much from him.</p>
<p>And yet, a flicker of doubt creeps in, uninvited and unwelcome.
What if he’s wrong? What if this act won’t bring the satisfaction
he craves but only deepen the chasm within him? The thought brushes
past him like a ghost, fleeting and intangible, before his anger
smothers it. Doubt is weakness, he tells himself. He can’t afford
to be weak—not now.</p>
<p>His thoughts spiral once more, faster and darker, until they
settle into a cold, focused resolve. He rises from the table, his
movements deliberate and mechanical, as though he has become an
instrument of his own will. Whatever humanity once resided in his
gaze has been swallowed by the abyss he carries within him.</p>
<p>This is what it feels like to become the storm, he thinks. To let
go of everything else and be consumed by the fury that has always
been there, waiting for its moment. As he steps out into the night,
the world blurs around him, and the weight of his decision presses
against his chest—not with guilt, but with the crushing
inevitability of a clock striking midnight.</p>

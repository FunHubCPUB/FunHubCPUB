[1.01]
There are a few people in my family that I call my enemies, in fact, most of them are poised against me and I fight them for my very freedom. My uncles, my aunts, and my mom and my cousins all view me as a schizophrenic person they seem to think is not worthy of their love. This battle has continued for years, with me forgiving them and starting fresh every once in a while, but they always reveal themselves as a detriment to my overall health and wellbeing. I’ve always been open to a positive relationship with them, but they want to argue with me about every single detail of what I say. They seem to fight a battle of words with me, picking apart my vocabulary and using it against me, forcing me to rephrase my speech into less offensive terms for them. But I’ve voiced my concerns in so many ways, it’s consolidated into a brainless goo like this previous paragraph. Let me try to express this again.
My small family is my nemesis when it comes to recovering from mental illness, and they’ve always been poised against me in this sinister way as I seek treatment for schizophrenia. Their judgment comes from ignorance about mental health, while they see my counseling as a reason to believe that I’m a problem person. They continue to identify me not by my personality or accomplishments, but solely on the basis of my diagnosis. I’ve been the victim of mental health stigma my entire adult life. Many of these family members became aware of me through my diagnosis with schizophrenia, and have actually never been my friends in any sense. All of the secret feelings of resentment were made clear when I started going to mental hospitals and taking medication, and as a result of these attacks on me, my life has been made all the more difficult. My aunts and uncles, cousins and parents all beset me with challenges that no ordinary person would normally have to face. I’ve been forced to live alone, with no support in the form of money or friendship, faced with extreme challenges like homelessness while they have observed me and mocked me instead of offering me a hand. It’s been a curse to be diagnosed with schizophrenia because my family doesn’t understand mental illness at all, and have attacked me for it for so long.
That’s a little better. See, I have these words I use to describe the situation like “isolation” and “attack,” and when I use them in writing over and over again they start to feel meaningless. These words are target points for their criticism of me, because they see what I say as a threat. As a career writer, I actually use language to express myself in a very serious way, and so this is a problem point for me. When they pick apart every word I say, and actually deny what I say on the basis of word choice, it starts to feel a lot like they’re gaslighting me. For example, I can say they “accused” me of something, but they will vehemently deny this, mocking me by replying, “I’ve never accused you of anything.” Which forces me to reply, “you’ve suspiciously suggested that you believe to be the case...” instead of simply using my vocabulary to express what I want. This denial on the basis of word choice is pervasive. When I bring up the neglect, they’ll use my words against me by saying I’m being unreasonable or cruel to them when I express things a certain way. They’ll avoid accountability by forcing me to reconsider what I say into a form they accept, which avoids the truth of the situation. This kind of thing is antithetical to recovery, because what I’m saying is actually a truthful account of my life situation. My words shouldn’t be questioned by their very definition, because when I communicate, I’m actually telling them one important point. I’m not mincing words, I’m communicating my needs in the only way I know how. It does ignite a sense of authorial outrage, as I spend a lot of effort trying to clearly communicate in a logical, rational way, and they deny everything I say and ignore long blocks of text that I write them to express myself that way.
The story truly is one of neglect, a word that I’ve tried to use to explain to them what is happening. When I tell them they’ve neglected me, they started seeing themselves as the victims, as they see themselves as the victims of my schizophrenia. They will strongly deny what is happening, and say they offered me all kinds of help, but they truly didn’t. When I lived alone, I had no means to live my life. I was not supposed to get a job, which I knew because I was on disability. They told me that I didn’t need a job, and the income was enough to live on. But I surely needed a job, as any regular person needs a job. I was forced to fill my days with activities that I had no idea how to accomplish. I was living in Broken Bow, and I didn’t know any people at all. I was not given any direction in my life after moving to Broken Bow. I was also left alone every day for weeks at a time, forced to fill my time with things that I should be doing. I have a hard time understanding what their intent was for what I was supposed to do. The only people I had contact with were people that lived on the streets as homeless people. I wasn’t introduced to any new social group when I moved to Broken Bow. The amount of stress I went through was through the roof, and they always blamed me when things didn’t work out. What I needed, of course, was my family’s time. I needed to be given activities that were positive. What my family did was rely on counseling as a total solution for my problems, when it only made things worse, and while I did improve, it was only through astronomical effort. I actually succeeded during this time in a lot of ways by reading, writing, and posting online and even making friends, even when they weren’t positive influences at all. I was forced to engage myself with drug addicts, and I can say I healthfully never became a drug addict myself. But the situation was intense and difficult for a long time, despite me being blamed.
There is one thing that helped me get through all of this, and that’s my computer use. It’s ironic that my family judges me for posting on Facebook and social media when, if it wasn’t for using a computer, I would have had absolutely no way to employ myself at all. I taught myself programming on Linux, and spent a lot of time with passion projects like writing and websites. I eventually spent all of my time working on these things. That’s why I say I’m a career writer. To reiterate, I was still neglected during this time. While it was being suggested that I was protected by my counseling, I was actually living an extremely risky life, trying to overcome serious problems that my family caused. Mostly, I didn’t have enough money to take care of myself. I was not given any sums of money that made it possible to live safely. I was given tiny amounts of money at a time, that I could only spend on cigarettes or alcohol. What I needed was money to invest in my hobbies, so I could fill my time as I had discovered was the best way to do so, on the computer. I needed money for subscriptions, software, and training so I could do the only that it was possible for me to do. Even after I showed that I was spending my time on computer stuff, I was neglected further by not being refocused on this activity, while my family showed no support for my efforts. I was not met with food, money, or travel needs, being forced to live inside my house with no transportation, no money, and no food to cook for weeks at a time. It’s very possible that my Mom was intentionally making my life difficult, by forcing me to live in a near-homeless way. What she wanted was for me to prove that I could live independently, but she was actually very ignorant to the fact that my needs were not being met. She increased my stress level to such a high point that I was hospitalized multiple times, when I simply couldn’t deal with the situation my family created for me.
I’ve written these words countless times. It beckons me to improve my vocabulary, as I find myself repeating the same words to describe this ongoing issue. If there was some way to show what has been going on, instead of telling them, I would definitely benefit. I could tell stories, write memoirs about these events. I should do so, but I do want to prepare my writing skills beforehand. I want to get into the writing mode more and more, and I want my writing to improve, so I think I’ll work on this.
It shouldn’t affect me, the way I’m being treated by my family. It sadly shows that I do have some basic need, but I would argue these needs are no different from any other person’s needs. I’ve tried to show my mom what I need through my actions, by explaining the results of her behavior and illustrating that I’m not to blame for what happened. When I moved to Idabel, after years of being tested physically and mentally in Broken Bow (quitting drinking, and overcoming the challenges of living nearly on the streets) I was taking care of myself very well. I was organized, and I was going to a therapist who served a different role than a behavioral counselor. I was cooking for myself, and I was overall very optimistic. There were people that lived in my apartment, however, that became problem people to me. What happened, was they would verbally accost me while I was in my apartment minding my own business. I eventually learned to respond to them, but they would ramp up the intensity of the fights until they were quite hard to deal with, and it became hard to live alone once again because of my neighbors. They saw me as someone who would counsel them, and deal with their problems they had in life, because they thought I had everything taken care of and was receiving all kinds of help from my family, but the truth was I was still experiencing the same kinds of neglect as before. I had been given the means to take care of my own needs, however, and it didn’t affect me as much until my mom increased my stress once again. She would encourage my neighbors to attack me by verbally assaulting me, and publicly blaming me for things I had no control over. She created a narrative that I was irresponsible, by talking to me in hateful ways in front of them, and even talking to my therapist in a negative way about me, and, in general, undermining my social life from the inside. She told me she was micromanaging me, but to me, this micromanagement only included ways she was increasing my stress. She created an avenue for abuse from my neighbors, and made me out to be a terrible person, and a target for them. The reason she did this is once again because she was punishing me for being schizophrenic. It was my family’s belief that I was a burden to them, and they were ignorant of true mental health recovery. She was testing me by making my life difficult, instead of improving my chances of success. She blamed me very seriously when I wouldn’t clean house, or I asked for money or food. She was also very aggressive whenever we were together, upsetting me a lot by ignoring me or saying things repeatedly that were designed to hurt me. I started feeling this was just how my mother was, and that she had a serious problem around then. When I was growing up, she was an addict, and she still was using meth, and I think that’s the source of her real issue. She would fight my stepdad in very serious, emotionally harmful ways by being manipulative and hurtful in the exact way that she was targeting me. After years of being away from her ex-husband, I had become her new target for abuse. I accepted this abuse at the time, because I didn’t recognize how truly harmful she was being. After she would attack me, and verbally abuse me, I was blamed for expressing any kind of emotional reaction to what she was doing, as she denied doing anything wrong and continued the behavior. It escalated to being a very bad situation for me, and as I was being neglected again in Idabel, I went to the mental hospital multiple times.
Maybe I should talk about the emotional side of this story, and try to get into the motivations that cause my family to do this to me and what it does to my feelings. I struggle with depression, and have had problems with it since I was an early teen, but I’ve found ways to cope, ignore the sadness, and stay happy, especially with the help of medication like antidepressants. What my problem is in effect is a tendency to become sad more easily, or be upset by general depression if I don’t stay on top of my feelings. It should be said I don’t believe I have schizophrenia, but instead atypical depression, which is perfectly described by what I just said, a sensitivity towards depression. When my family continuously assaults me with judgments over time, it does make me slowly become more depressed. I will spend most of my day miserable with sadness because they’ve decided to stubbornly deny my existence and refute all the claims I’ve made about neglect and my willingness to overcome my obstacles with their help. One of the most terrifying aspects of this is how my mom seems to actually resent my happiness, and not value it, in such a way that when she sees that I’m happy she immediately begins mocking me, and feels she needs to bring me down back into a depressed state. Another scary aspect of my depression is how my family views that because I’m sad, I’m some kind of monster. I don’t know if they think I should be happy no matter what, but when I show sadness, they nullify that experience by denying that it’s okay to feel sad, and vilify me. They’re not only scared of me because I’m diagnosed with schizophrenia, but they fear that I’m depressed. Since I believe my main problem is depression, I also don’t have any support in this regard by my family. When I ask for verbal support if I’m feeling sad, I get attacked, mocked, or derided based on what I say, and they deny my feelings and refuse to help me. I’ve expressed that I’m depressed for a long time, and my mom has shown that she’s terrified by it, and sees me as a monster, because she takes personal offense to any writing that I make expressing sadness. And she has stated that she thinks I’m an unhappy person because I’m not capable of being happy, suggesting that it’s a flaw and that nothing can make me happy, which couldn’t be further from the truth. When I was taking care of myself finally in Idabel, I was happy for the first time in a long time. It wasn’t until I became aware the neglect would continue that I started feeling upset again, and while I was maintaining my happiness, I also felt very low, which contributed to a very bipolar kind of emotion for me. She made me feel unstable, because she was attacking me at the very support structures that I created for myself to keep myself happy. She frighteningly attacked me over and over again, until, at this stage, I am actually a lot more depressed than I was when this started happening again over 4 years ago. 
The problem is they don’t value me or view me as a real person because of my diagnosis. They’ve shown they see me as a burden and don’t feel the need to help me because they’re victimizing themselves due to me being schizophrenic. They see themselves as the victims of my mental health. They have taken a stubborn, aggressive stance when it comes to how to treat me, and this is why they keep their distance and allow me to fail while I’m being neglected. They don’t listen to anything I say because they don’t think it’s coming from a real person. Nothing I say will convince them otherwise--I would likely need a team of experts to intervene on my behalf to convince them to stop. They also don’t realize the significance of their actions on my life because they don’t view me as important. This is also why they don’t see my successes as truly important, because they think of me as an insignificant person. They are on the outside of my life, waiting for me to fail because they want me to totally give up on independence, and validate their damning opinions of me. This is happening to me because I have nobody in my corner to stand up for me in my entire family. I have no father, no brothers or sisters, and this causes their network of communication to reinforce my flaws. Right now, each one of them has their own negative opinion of me that I cannot sway in a positive direction, because they’ve discussed me in the dark for years and they’ve never reconsidered how they feel. I’ve been ignoring it for a long time, because I thought their might be some redeeming attribute of their behavior. Perhaps they were testing me so I could succeed, as I have done with personal computing and online? But I can see now, through an effort of focus, they don’t want me to succeed, and don’t value my success. They’re not on my side, and it’s not benefiting me to accept their behavior at all, because it will only continue and I will never recover from any kind of mental illness with their help.

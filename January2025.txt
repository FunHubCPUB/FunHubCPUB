Hello. This is not a novel. I’ve turned my first chapters into journal entries for sharing my thoughts. I want to do the best I can, always. I want to fall in love and write poetry. I love each and every one of you. I feel a lot of empathy for the human race. Sometimes, I feel deeply sad for the condition a person has found me in. I see their struggle, their confusion. I wonder what I would do in their shoes. 
I want to make great progress in the production of my works. I have set a lofty goal, in fact, it’s most likely unachievable. I would have to write 375 words per hour, 8 hours a day, five days a week, for three years to meet my goal. That’s 24 novels, about 300 or 400 pages each. I want to sell the novels for five dollars each on Amazon. When I meet my goals for a number of completed novels, I want to turn them into paperbacks. It seems the biggest task right now is streamlining my writing output. Philip K Dick was a prolific writer, who was considered a graphomaniac--he wrote a lot very quickly. I want to do that, but I have yet to test myself. Maybe if I start slow, I can grow my skills.
I want the dialogue to be memorable, and I want my narration to be poetic. I need to focus on first person, then move to third person omniscient. I need to develop scenes, write chapters, study plot templates, to write so many books. I want to use Grammarly to edit them. It seems like the choice for getting professional results. The page is currently littered with suggestions by Grammarly. I’ll tell you when I’ve written 475 words.
I’ve always been good at telling stories. I have practiced story writing, and can produce prose. I can also outline stories, but I want to use a method called discovery writing to write these novels. I want to go where the story takes me, without a lot of preplanning. I want to explore deep thoughts I have, and reflect in between writing sessions. My first drafts will be quick and easy, and at the end of the biyearly cycle, I’ll edit what I have. I want to write one new novel per month. I think I can at least write something, even if it takes me a few tries to get going.
I want to model my novels from the templates created by Philip K Dick. I want the genre to be science fiction, so that I can focus on a theme like mental illness or modern technology to create a fictional setting that’s quite imaginative. I think I can come up with one idea per month for an entire novel, and write every day to get the rough draft by the end of the month. It’s been 475 words.
My flow includes sharing the updated rough drafts every day online. I know people won’t check every day, but I can link the works in progress for people to read when they want to. This also serves the purpose of giving me a way to check what I’ve written, and read it outside of the word processor to plan and review. This will give me more ideas for what to write about. 
I don’t want to worry about editing at a sentence level, because I feel I have a natural mastery of sentences. While I’m writing rough drafts, I’ll mostly focus on paragraphs. I’ll want to flow the story paragraph by paragraph to maintain a rigid structure and pacing. For dialogue, I want to include great phrases, and have characters deliver amazing lines. I don’t think I’ll use Grammarly until the end of the season to perfect the writing at a sentence level. 
I really don’t know how it’ll go. I hope for the best. I’m surely telling everyone I’m a full-time writer starting in January. I’ve also figured out the economics of it. I should sell 600 books a month to make nearly $2,000, the maximum I’m allowed to make as side-income with my fixed income check I receive from the government. That’s $5 an ebook with 70% royalties. If I publish 24 ebooks, by the time I’m done I’ll need to sell 25 of each book per month to make the same amount. That’s quite low volume. I don’t want to write these books for money, but when I’m done pouring so much time into them, it would be nice to have a steady source of side-income. 
Sometimes I think I don’t have the mind for writing books. Sometimes, my short term memory seems slow. But this will improve if I continue reading on the side. And my brain will compensate the more I practice. I do have the ability to write books, as long as I’m not a perfectionist. I’ve tried for so long to write the next Fellowship of the Ring, when I’m more likely to write The Catcher in the Rye, a shorter fiction book with less scope and poetic, personal feelings, not epic world building requiring hours of dedication and preplanning. 
I have three books I’m reading/going to read. Moby Dick -- which I plan on re-reading. Ulysses -- my hero, James Joyce. And Exegesis -- Philip K Dick, his mind, his art and his ideas all rolled into one book. I want to also collect multiple books by ordering them used for my study. I don’t seem to learn as well from online resources, unless I collect the documents and reread them multiple times. I tend to read very fast or skim reading on my computer screen. I think reading will play a big role in improving my writing skills, and allowing me to write novels. 
When I wrote The Cult, my strongest advantage was the unreliable narrator. Maybe, if I don’t focus on true accuracy, and capture the voices of my characters, I’ll have an easier time. I’ll be writing scenes much like a movie script, advancing the plot with events that take place. I’ll want to introduce new settings and characters with unique traits. I will want to study Jung’s personality types for examining the differences between these characters. I’ll describe settings from the narrator’s perspective. When events happen, I’ll have to focus my efforts on pacing. This will primarily be what I focus on for rough drafts. I can’t wait to be in the mode where I can write consistently, because it pleases me in a deep way. It’s one of the only ways I feel productive, by the way. If I’ve produced a piece of writing that I think is somewhat valuable, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment. When I’m in my career writing mode, I view my accomplishments as examples of what I have written. I may not be lying when I say my job is a full-time writer--I will likely feel a great sense of productivity once I get started. 
I’m 39% through with my daily goal, by the way.
Rough drafts are the most effective way to get writing done. By putting your ideas on paper without editing, you can get more accomplished. I sometimes edit while I’m writing, and after I get faster at writing the first draft I may do a light second draft before I reach the editing stage. That means reading over what I have just written and reorganizing it for continuity, adding sentences, and sometimes fixing grammatical mistakes. 
It strikes me that I will guide my reader along a path I share with them. I will want to focus on creating a sense of drama, of promises kept and events foreshadowed. I’ll have to think ahead somewhat, even if my style goal is a sense of disorganization. I will most likely have intense scenes and periods of writing, and I should mostly focus on building up to those, because they are the greatest scenes for my reader. I don’t think I’ll have to worry about repetition or sentence structure, as I mentioned it’s my strong point. My main problem will be pacing, and worrying about when to go on tangents, and how to follow the events of the story in a way that makes dramatic sense.
There are plot templates such as the Hero’s Journey or Boy Meets Girl that I’m somewhat familiar with that I will most likely use to guide myself through the scenes. I’ll probably write relatively short chapters, each chapter containing one scene. I’ve thought out most of my writing quirks and fantasies that I would have to keep in mind when writing a novel, finally putting together the pieces of my dreams after years of attempts. I’m also capable of poetry, which I hope will inspire me to continue to write through the sluggish parts of my novels. And, ideally, there will be no sluggish parts of the writing, keeping everything focused for my reader who may seem to write alongside me. 
Pacing myself, beyond pacing of the novel, will be somewhat difficult. I may go on tangents that fill up too much space, or cut scenes short due to lack of inspiration. Part of this will require maintaining my voice. The tangents of my narrator will make sense to the reader if I continue to sound like the same narrator as I write it. I may even experience burnout from using the same voice for long sections of writing. But I’ve a plan for that, too. I want to create multiple “parts” for each novel, larger sections that divide the chapters. That’s why I’ve chosen this naming scheme for my chapters: [1.01] [2.01] and so on. The only limitation is with these decimals, I’m limited to 99 chapters per section. 
The first section might be establishing the setting, characters, and plot. The next part could be the rising action or midpoint, the real conflict of the novel. The third part might be the climax and resolution. These templates comfort me that I can do this. Not expanding my scope to such a great level has been my problem with writing longer works. Often, my scope exceeds the style of my story, and I wind down the plot all-too-quickly. I bring up large elements of the plot too quickly, and wind down the conflict similarly, which shortens the length of my stories. I start expositing the plot instead of telling a real story, at least in the style of a novel. 
I think I can be very clever in my narration. Once I get used to a certain voice, I can compress meanings into poetic language. I can add metaphors and figures of speech (something this chapter has so far been lacking.) I can also write more than one chapter per day. For example, I feel this chapter is nearing its end, but I’m 60% of my goal. I could easily reorient, plan my next chapter/topic/scene, and come back to writing to write some completely new style. 3000 words a day is less than I am capable of, but is still a big goal for one writer, especially over multiple days. I’ve calculated I can write at most 5000 words a day, so I’ll be writing close to my maximum every day. It probably will be hard to do it day after day, but I plan to set my work hours between 9-5, staying close to my laptop during that time and never hesitating to put words on the page when I get the inspiration. I already have a sedentary lifestyle, with no responsibilities, so dedicating myself to these timeframes will come naturally. It seems I may procrastinate sometimes, but with a worthwhile workflow, I’ll be rewarded enough to continue working hard.
I want to include lots of emotion like sympathy and empathy, but I think it would be wise to avoid voicing frustrations or anger. I would be apt to distance myself from my own writing if it was a source of discomfort to finish scenes. Also, I don’t think I would like the posterity of anger or rants to be put in my novels, and I don’t think readers will appreciate it.
My main to-do list is to continue reading, mark my writing hours, continue with my work flow, and make rough drafts of scenes every day until I get a novel done. Month by month, I’ll conceptualize new novels and continue writing until I have multiple books for sale, up to the number of 24 novels by the time I call it quits. If I write at this pace, I’ll have 8 novels a year, if each novel is deemed successful. In 3 years, I’ll have 24 books. I surely hope I can do it. Won’t you do it with me?

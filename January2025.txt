[1.01]
There are a few people in my family that I call my enemies, in fact, most of them are poised against me and I fight them for my very freedom. My uncles, my aunts, and my mom and my cousins all view me as a schizophrenic person they seem to think is not worthy of their love. This battle has continued for years, with me forgiving them and starting fresh every once in a while, but they always reveal themselves as a detriment to my overall health and wellbeing. I’ve always been open to a positive relationship with them, but they want to argue with me about every single detail of what I say. They seem to fight a battle of words with me, picking apart my vocabulary and using it against me, forcing me to rephrase my speech into less offensive terms for them. But I’ve voiced my concerns in so many ways, it’s consolidated into a brainless goo like this previous paragraph. Let me try to express this again.
My small family is my nemesis when it comes to recovering from mental illness, and they’ve always been poised against me in this sinister way as I seek treatment for schizophrenia. Their judgment comes from ignorance about mental health, while they see my counseling as a reason to believe that I’m a problem person. They continue to identify me not by my personality or accomplishments, but solely on the basis of my diagnosis. I’ve been the victim of mental health stigma my entire adult life. Many of these family members became aware of me through my diagnosis with schizophrenia, and have actually never been my friends in any sense. All of the secret feelings of resentment were made clear when I started going to mental hospitals and taking medication, and as a result of these attacks on me, my life has been made all the more difficult. My aunts and uncles, cousins and parents all beset me with challenges that no ordinary person would normally have to face. I’ve been forced to live alone, with no support in the form of money or friendship, faced with extreme challenges like homelessness while they have observed me and mocked me instead of offering me a hand. It’s been a curse to be diagnosed with schizophrenia because my family doesn’t understand mental illness at all, and have attacked me for it for so long.
That’s a little better. See, I have these words I use to describe the situation like “isolation” and “attack,” and when I use them in writing over and over again they start to feel meaningless. These words are target points for their criticism of me, because they see what I say as a threat. As a career writer, I actually use language to express myself in a very serious way, and so this is a problem point for me. When they pick apart every word I say, and actually deny what I say on the basis of word choice, it starts to feel a lot like they’re gaslighting me. For example, I can say they “accused” me of something, but they will vehemently deny this, mocking me by replying, “I’ve never accused you of anything.” Which forces me to reply, “you’ve suspiciously suggested that you believe to be the case...” instead of simply using my vocabulary to express what I want. This denial on the basis of word choice is pervasive. When I bring up the neglect, they’ll use words against me by saying I’m being unreasonable or cruel to them when I express things a certain way. They’ll avoid accountability by forcing me to reconsider what I say into a form they accept, which avoids the truth of the situation. This kind of thing is really antithetical to recovery, because what I’m saying is actually a truthful account of my life situation. My words shouldn’t be questioned by their very definition, because when I communicate, I’m actually telling them one important point. I’m not mincing words, I’m communicating my needs in the only way I know how. It does ignite a sense of authorial outrage, as I spend a lot of effort trying to clearly communicate in a logical, rational way, and they deny everything I say and ignore long blocks of text that I write them to express myself that way.

<p class="western">Step into the <strong>Artist</strong> section,
where imagination takes center stage, and creativity flows without
boundaries. This is more than a gallery; it's a dynamic space that
evolves with every stroke of inspiration, reflecting the artist's
journey through different states of mind, emotions, and ideas.</p>
<p class="western">This is the heart of FunHub, where the artist’s
soul finds expression, and visitors are invited to reflect, connect,
and create. Welcome to a space where art is alive, evolving, and
uniquely personal.</p>
<h1>[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">For my first writing project, I submit <a href="http://funhub.lol/weed.html">My
Weed Book</a>, the inspiration for this blog. With entries detailing
my previous existence in Broken Bow, I explore the effects of weed
and the behavior of similarly near-homeless people I interacted with.</p>
<p class="western">I want to explore my fascination with Phil Dick in
future entries. While I view him as the greatest American author of
the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, I study him and particularly his
Exegesis, learning insights into his personality. His style is
quintessential to my growing art form. 
</p>
<p class="western">Phil Dick was a “graphomaniac” meaning his
abilities included writing very quickly for long periods of time.
This made him a prolific writer. In FunHub, I hope to mimic his
graphomania and write as much as humanly possible. This section,
“Artist,” won’t include any AI generated content, but the
section titled “Code” will. “Learn” may be a mix of real
writing from me and AI content.</p>
<p class="western">I’ll be exploring my theories on biology,
religion, and science. I hope to create a hub of speculative content
on the nature of life on earth, and the mysteries of the universe. I
want it to be a sounding board for my imagination and a
representation of my creativity. I hope to share my emotions with
these works, characterizing my own soul in the process. I want to
talk about the things I love, and share the deep meaning my life has
for me.</p>
<p class="western">I’m an agnostic, with a propensity to believe in
God. I want this place to be the foundation of that core belief. I
won’t hesitate to share my deepest thoughts, and I will always
maintain honesty and integrity in the things I share. I won’t feel
censored, or even hold back anything I want to say about any topic.
The blank canvas is waiting.

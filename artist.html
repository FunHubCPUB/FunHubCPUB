<a href="http://funhub.lol/"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Artist</font></a></p>
<h1 class="western">[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">For my first writing project, I submit <a href="http://funhub.lol/weed.html">My
Weed Book</a>, the inspiration for this blog. With entries detailing
my previous existence in Broken Bow, I explore the effects of weed
and the behavior of similarly near-homeless people I interacted with.</p>
<p class="western">I want to explore my fascination with Phil Dick in
future entries. While I view him as the greatest American author of
the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, I study him and particularly his
Exegesis, learning insights into his personality. His style is
quintessential to my growing art form. 
</p>
<p class="western">Phil Dick was a “graphomaniac” meaning his
abilities included writing very quickly for long periods of time.
This made him a prolific writer. In FunHub, I hope to mimic his
graphomania and write as much as humanly possible. This section,
“Artist,” won’t include any AI generated content, but the
section titled “Code” will. “Learn” may be a mix of real
writing from me and AI content.</p>
<p class="western">I’ll be exploring my theories on biology,
religion, and science. I hope to create a hub of speculative content
on the nature of life on earth, and the mysteries of the universe. I
want it to be a sounding board for my imagination and a
representation of my creativity. I hope to share my emotions with
these works, characterizing my own soul in the process. I want to
talk about the things I love, and share the deep meaning my life has
for me.</p>
<p class="western">I’m an agnostic, with a propensity to believe in
God. I want this place to be the foundation of that core belief. I
won’t hesitate to share my deepest thoughts, and I will always
maintain honesty and integrity in the things I share. I won’t feel
censored, or even hold back anything I want to say about any topic.
The blank canvas is waiting. 
</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.02]</h1>
<p class="western">These are my stories posted on <a href="http://funhub.lol/twitter.html">X
(Twitter)</a>. They seem to scale upwards, exploring common themes
like culture and progress. They’re mostly fantasy or science
fiction. I want these stories to continue to grow as I post to my
audience on the X platform. I barely get any impressions or likes,
comments but I have them posted for the occasional person to see. 
</p>
<p class="western">This format is my preferred way of writing,
entries that successively build upon each other. Expect to see more
content in this layout. I want to write flash fiction stories like
these in the future. I also want journals, books, papers, and
philosophy, science, theology works published on FunHub. It’s up to
me to keep writing, and as this site grows I’ll update the layout
of the pages to include my new stories. 
</p>
<p class="western">I want to explore my ideas about the evolution of
the human body, our remarkable brains, and our amazing ability to
technologically adapt. We are in a revolutionary time where our
progress is quite rapid. With my philosophy in mind, I want to become
a “thoughtfluencer,” encouraging thinkers to question the norms
and express themselves to achieve their highest potential. I want to
impact the world through my writing.</p>
<p class="western">I want to be completely honest about my feelings,
to give credo to the things I write. I’ll never imagine something
false to share with the world with the intention to lie. While I may
broach subjects that seem unbelievable, I do it with full
transparency. I don’t know if the things I say are true, I merely
<i>wonder</i><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">at
the truth. I think we are at the cusp of something great in humanity,
and I hope I can find out what it is.</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0in">
Like Phil Dick, I want to be a voice of the century, who shares his
inner world without shame. Some of what I post on FunHub will seem
schizophrenic, or delusional, but I understand the nature of wisdom
to be that we must always assume we are probably wrong. This is what
I actually believe. I want to influence the world, but I do not want
to bend it to my will. Hopefully I have something great to
contribute.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.03]</h1>
<p class="western">My next book project, concurrent with My Weed
Book, is <a href="http://funhub.lol/delilah.html">Delilah 2025</a>, a
novel of fantasy and modernity. It will feature ten chapters, and
take place during the span of one day and the next morning. I will
explore themes of family, mental health, and mysticism, as the main
character experiences waking dreams that span the cosmos.</p>
<p class="western">I plan to implement motifs into each chapter, by
implementing stylistic choices that repeat themselves and change over
time, such as the use of colors or specific people in my life as a
reference frame. While it’s not autobiographical, I hope to express
my personality to the fullest. I want to show my great hopes for the
future, my commanding creativity in solving problems, my strength of
character in the face of adversity, and describe all the things in my
life that I treasure most.</p>
<p class="western">I haven’t started writing it, but I’ve put the
page up for now, to be updated later. I’ve said anyone can write a
book in 15 days, as Andy Warhol said everyone will be famous for
fifteen minutes. A single book might have 50,000 words, which would
be less than 5,000 words a day. My pace is around 5,000 words a day,
so you could assume that I have this book ready in 15 writing
workdays. I procrastinate, however, and some days write very little,
waiting for the perfect mindset to write. I hope to overcome this
soon.</p>
<p class="western">I think the book should be written before the end
of 2025, being the book is set during 2025. That means, I only have
to write 15 days out of the next 365, and I think that’s doable.
Look forward to the book being updated at that link.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.04]</h1>
<p class="western">I need a place to post what is simply <a href="http://funhub.lol/flash.html">flash
fiction</a>. My favorite form of art, flash fiction are short stories
that are even shorter than usual. They help me convey ideas
succinctly, and adapt well to internet audiences, whose attention
spans are more limited. I like to expand the scope of my flash
fiction to enormous proportions, and challenge the everyday with much
grandiosity. Sometimes, prompts help to write your own flash fiction,
but I’ve practiced enough I can effectively write my own prompts. 
</p>
<p class="western">You’ll notice a lot of my flash fictions end on
a note where they begin. I learned this from studying novels, the
best of which cover their theme from start to finish. I like to loop
back to the beginning for dramatic effect. I will also include
comedic drama draped upon the science fiction plot. I like to show my
sense of humor. 
</p>
<p class="western">Flash fiction is a great way for me to show my
writing skill. I can create intriguing premises that explore my
imaginative side. The drama of my stories often elicits a reaction of
some kind. Readers seem to like my flash fiction best. My book is
full of flash fiction, and I’ve written hundreds of them as an
adult. My pace is higher when writing flash fiction, because it seems
obvious where to go, what to write. And I can express my greatest
ideas through a simple, short flash.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.05]</h1>
<p class="western">Click <a href="http://funhub.lol/publishing.html">here</a>
to see the Copypasta Publishing (FunHub) page for my new books. Check
back here often to become a beta reader. Updated daily with
works-in-progress. New books are published in April and October on
Kindle. My pace has been rather slow. I’m improving through daily
practice. It seems with the help of AI I’m able to work out how to
write new genres and styles. AI is proving to be a powerful tool to
help me with content creation. 
</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.06]</h1>
<p class="western" align="justify">AI is now capable of creative
writing of a high quality, and I find it fascinating. The stories and
responses are fun to read, and trying to extricate the best story
from a prompt is a fun challenge. I have been creating a list of AI
writing which you can visit <a href="http://funhub.lol/ai.html">here</a>.
You can visit the second page of AI-generated stories at this link:
<a href="https://funhub.lol/ai2.html">AI Stories</a>. This second
page I consider a small ebook, as I have licensed it to be shared
freely with attribution to the author. It spans 9 dimensions,
featuring 6 microstories in each dimension, crafted to perfection
using AI. There were very few edits to these stories, because I only
made small changes, choosing to keep every word of the output from
the LLM. It’s very impressive what technology was able to do! <a href="https://funhub.lol/1740059614643.jpg">Cover</a></p>
<h1 class="western">[1.07]</h1>
<p class="western">The index of FunHub is being relocated to <a href="https://funhub.lol/app/index.html">this</a>
location. I have updated this version of the index with several basic
pages representing my creative writing. These pages are all
accessible at the <a href="https://github.com/FunHubCPUB/FunHubCPUB">FunHub
GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h1 class="western">[1.08]</h1>
<p class="western">I have created an NFT collection for you to enjoy.
By paying a low fee (less than one cent!) I can add you to my page
here on FunHub, and you will be given a special NFT that you can keep
for all time. Write an entry yourself, and mint the NFT with your
wallet address by logging in with Metamask or any other Ethereum
wallet. You don’t need any crypto!</p>
<p class="western">Celo is a green, mobile-first and
developer-friendly Layer-2 Ethereum token that can be purchased from
exchanges like Coinbase. I  buy the CELO token (just enough for a
long, long time) and mint the NFTs to your Ethereum wallet address.
The NFT that you mint will be available on the Celo Mainnet
blockchain, as well as viewable at <a href="https://funhub.lol/app/nfts.html">this</a>
FunHub.lol link. 
</p>
<p class="western">As for what you can post, the sky’s the limit!
Write text about any topic, from religion to biology, and everything
in between. They say all science can be reduced to its subject
matter, and one day, with the help of my users, I hope everything
known to man is written on this website. 
</p>
<p class="western">Here’s an even more exciting part. Not only will
you be given an NFT, but for every FUN_NFT ERC-721 token you mint,
you’ll also be awarded 1 of our new $CPUB ERC-20 (fungible) tokens.
These tokens don’t serve a purpose, yet, but when I put other parts
of our DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) online, they will
earn you a larger share of the treasury, a pool of funds that are
traded and dispensed according to voters in the network. When the
organization receives votes at the beginning of every month it
initiates a payout. The more CPUB you own, the larger fraction of the
treasury will be awarded to you during payouts.</p>
